# Fighting CopyCat Agents Behavioral Cloning from Observation Histories

This is the code of the paper [Fighting CopyCat Agents Behavioral Cloning from Observation Histories](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2020/file/1b113258af3968aaf3969ca67e744ff8-Paper.pdf).
This code has implemented the most important part of our contribution â€” Target-Conditioned Adversary module.
And it also supports two important baselines: BC-SO and BC-OH. 

## Dependencies

```shell script
conda create -n fight-copycat python=3.6
conda activate fight-copycat
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

First, generate the dataset (can be skipped because the data has been generated and saved in ./data/trajectories):

```python
python -m imitation_learning.gen_data Hopper 50000
```

Then normalize the dataset (can be skipped because it has been normalized):

```python
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main.py normalize env=Hopper config/hopper.yaml
```

Behavioral cloning with single observation:

```python
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main.py main env=Hopper config/hopper.yaml name=Hopper-bcso policy.policy_mode=bc-so
```

Behavioral cloning with observation histories:

```python
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main.py main env=Hopper config/hopper.yaml name=Hopper-bcoh policy.policy_mode=bc-oh
```

Our algorithm (FCA):
```python
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main.py main env=Hopper config/hopper.yaml name=Hopper-fca policy.policy_mode=fca optim.discriminator_lr=4e-4 policy.gan_loss_weight=2.0
```
